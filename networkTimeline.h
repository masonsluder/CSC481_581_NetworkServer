/**
* The Timeline class manages the passage of time for relevant processes within the
* game engine. It can also be used to anchor to other Timelines to fix its passage of
* time to be in relation to the anchor.
*
* This class was refactored to be a more in-depth Timeline implementation using the
* slides on Time presented in class:
* https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EZ9PFmYsufonouzSsVSzEfTW6dvkegJ7/edit#slide=id.p69
